1. the length of i since var is function scoped
2. an error since its declared and init in the loop. so undefined
3. the correct discounted price
4. [50,100,150]
5. should be error since let is block scoped
6. error let is blockscoped
7. 150 since it'll hold the last discounted price
8. [50,100,150] the loop discount the price and pushes it to discounted. then returns it
9. error let is blockscoped
10. output 3 since thats the length of the array of prices input
11. [50,100,150] the const on discounted keeps it being an array so it can be pushed on
12.
    a. student.name
    b. student['Grad Year']
    c. student.greeting()
    d. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    e. student.courseLoad[0]
13.  
    a. '32'         3 concat with string version of 2
    b. 1            3 the number - 2
    c. 3            null is 0
    d. '3null'      concat with string null
    e. 4            true = 1
    f. 0            0 + 0
    g. '3undefined' string 3 plus undefined string
    h. NAN          undefined is nan
14.  
    a. true         number 2 > 1
    b. false        this is string comp of 2 vs 1 ascii
    c. true         '2' becomes number 2
    d. false        === checks value and type
    e. false        true = 1
    f. true         boolean(2) is true which is === true
15. == tries to make them the same type before comparing
    === directly compares value and type
17. [2,4,6] in the loop, doSomething is called back using each number of array. which then mults2 and pushes to newArr
19. 1,4,3,2
